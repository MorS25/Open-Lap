OpenLap has developed own transponders. They are only 14*19mm and below 1g!
60 IDs are supported this time. On the transponders is a button and led indicators for easy change of the ID.


##Receiver

Instead of other timing hardware OpenLap is really simple!
Only one 7$ board and four 1$ Sensors are necessary to make it work.
It can be used wireless (with a small extra tool running on your pc) or wired over USB.
No setup has to be done. Once uploaded the software the hardware detects automatic the software used.


##How to start

1. Grab a transponder (build one yourselve or get one from official reseller (currently working on this..)). If you build one yourselfe here's [how to upload the software](docs/Transponder%20Update.md). 
2. Plug it in a free 5V source. Make sure you can draw enough current. Short pulses are over 100mA. Maybe an extra 47-100ÂµF Elko on 5V rails is recommended if you notice some trouble. To set up your wanted ID follow [this guide](docs/Transponder.md).
3. To set up the receiver follow [this guide](docs/Receiver.md).

Now you're ready to use :)
